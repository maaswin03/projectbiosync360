PROJECT NAME: BioSync360Â° - The Future of Rural Healthcare

Problem Statement: Many communities, especially rural areas, have limited access to healthcare facilities, and medical services are often expensive. How can digital platforms, telemedicine, or AI-powered diagnostics improve healthcare access and affordability for underserved populations

Proposed solution: Our project "BIOSYNC360" where the solution aims in HEALTH CARE IN RURAL AREAS are designed to monitor the patient's health conditions in an effective and cost efficient way. The solution comprises of both hardware and software where the hardware consists ESP32 microcontroller which has inbuilt wifi to communicate with the server and sensors such as MAX30100(monitors blood oxygen level and pulse rate), DS18B20 (to monitor body temperature), AD8232(ECG sensor to monitor the electrical activity of the heart), SEN-11574( to monitor the heart rate) are connected to the microcontroller. All these sensors are used and the data is collected and sent to the MongoDB for storage purpose and to analyse these data for later purpose. The stored data are retrieved to the website whose frontend is created using React.js, Chart.js, Lealet.js,css and the backend is created using Node.js and express.js.The website consists of pages such as HEALTH TRACKING where all the data if the sensors are collected and shown in graph format, PERSONALISED PLANNING which provides physical health care routines in order to maintain good health and well-being, WELLNESS INSIGHTS where patient can address the health inconvenience faced and obtain the future health issues which occurs and also provides medication, and DOCTOR-PATIENT CONSULTANTION providing both audio and video consultantion facilities and AI CHAT BOT to clarify health related doubts.
