TEAM NAME: TEAM ELITE

PROJECT NAME: BioSync360Â° - The Future of Rural Healthcare

Problem Statement: Many communities, especially rural areas, have limited access to healthcare facilities, and medical services are often expensive. How can digital platforms, telemedicine, or AI-powered diagnostics improve healthcare access and affordability for underserved populations

Proposed solution: Our solution comprises hardware and software that collects the real-time data such as Body temperature, Blood oxygen level, ECG and pulse rate monitoring. These data are collected and sent to the website via Wifi which has features such as HEALTH TRACKING, PERSONALIZED PLANNING, WELLNESS INSIGHTS, DOCTOR PATIENT CONSULTANTION and AI CHATBOT.
